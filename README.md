## General info
![Architecture](./assets/architecture2.png)

This repository contains everything you need to create 'Live Objects to Azure IoT Hub' connector. This project is intended for Live Objects users wishing to explore integration patterns with Azure and for organizations already running business logic on Azure planning to work on events from IoT devices sourced via Live Objects.

Three main features are:
* **devices synchronization** - every device registered in Live Objects will appear  in IoT Hub and every device deleted from Live Objects will be also deleted from IoT Hub 
* **messages synchronization** - every message which will be send from device to Live Objects will appear in IoT Hub
* **commands synchronization** - every command from IoT Hub will be sent to the devices via Live Objects API

One connector can handle many Live Objects accounts and Iot Hubs. 

It can be only one instance of connector per Live Objects account. Two or more instances connected to the same Live Objects account will cause problems.

The software is an open source toolbox which has to be integrated into an end to end solution. The ordering of messages is not guaranteed to be preserved; the application uses thread pools to run its MQTT and IoT Hub adapters which may cause some messages to arrive in IoT Hub out of order in which they were kept within Live Objectsâ€™ MQTT queue.
Live Objects platform supports load balancing between multiple MQTT subscribers.

## Technologies

#### api-key
Live Objects API key with at least DEVICE_R, DEVICE_W and BUS_R roles

Login to Live Objects Web Portal an go to **Administration** -> **API keys** 

![Api Keys 1](./assets/api_key_1.png) 

Click **Add** button and fill fields. 

![Api Keys 2](./assets/api_key_2_.png)

To  validate  the  creation  of  the  key,  click  on  the  **Create**  button.  Your  key  is  generated  in  the form of an alphanumeric sequence and aQR code.

#### api-url
REST API endpoint url, leave the value of https://liveobjects.orange-business.com/api

#### uri
Live Objects mqtt url, leave the value of ssl://liveobjects.orange-business.com:8883

#### username
Live Objects mqtt username (should be set to **application**)

#### clientId
Unique identifier for client connected to the broker. Can be freely changed

#### recovery-interval
Controls the interval (in miliseconds) at which the mqtt client attempts to reconnect after a failure. It defaults to 10000ms (10 seconds)

#### completion-timeout
Set the completion timeout for mqtt operations in miliseconds

#### connection-timeout
This value, measured in seconds, defines the maximum time interval the client will wait for the network connection to the MQTT server to be established

#### keep-alive-interval-seconds
This value, measured in seconds, defines the maximum time interval between messages sent or received. It enables the client to detect if the server is no longer available, without having to wait for the TCP/IP timeout. The client will ensure that at least one message travels across the network within each keep alive period.  In the absence of a data-related message during the time period, the client sends a very small "ping" message, which the server will acknowledge. A value of 0 disables keepalive processing in the client.

#### qos
Message QoS 

#### page-size
Maximum number of devices in single response. Max 1000

#### synchronization-device-interval
Controls the interval (in seconds) at which device synchronization process starts.

### Logging
Logging configuration can be found in **logback.xml** file located in src/main/resources. You can find more information about how to configure your logs [here](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html)

### Azure Webapp Maven Plugin
Deployment to Azure is performed by the Azure Webapp Maven Plugin. Its configuration is included in `pom.xml` file within the connector project.
The following lines are relevant:

```
<resourceGroup>YourResourceGroupName</resourceGroup>
<appServicePlanName>YourAppServicePlanName</appServicePlanName>
<appName>lo2iothub</appName>
```

The `resourceGroup` and `appServicePlanName` should correspond to values provided during App Service Plan creation. These values can be found in the details of the App Service Plan:  

![Service Plan 1](./assets/service_plan_1.png) 

Application name will be used to uniquely identify the deployed connector app.

### Installation

In order to be deployed to Azure, the project uses Azure Webapp Maven Plugin. The installation description is based on the following [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/spring-framework/deploy-spring-boot-java-app-with-maven-plugin).

#### Azure login

In order to deploy the application, the prerequisite is to have a logged session to Azure. Run the following command using Azure CLI tool:
```
az login
```
Follow the instructions to complete the login process. 

#### Build and deployment of the connector

Build the JAR file using command:
```
mvn clean package
```
Deploy the application with the command:
```
mvn azure-webapp:deploy
```

If you repeat those steps, application will be redeployed, replacing the previously-deployed instance on Azure. Please keep in mind that you donâ€™t have to repeat the login to Azure (unless the session expired, which will result in appropriate error message during app deployment).
